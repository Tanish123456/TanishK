        <h1>My Favourite Hobby is Cycling!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I like cycling because it is fun and cycling is healthy for us. If I get bored or have nothing to do I go ride my cycle around my apartment. Cycling combines physical exercise with being outdoors and exploring new views. You can ride solo â€“ giving you time to process worries or concerns, or you can ride with a group which broadens your social circle.

        <p>My father inspired me because he guides me along my path and teaches me new things that schools don't teach. Sometimes if I do something wrong he maks me understand how important disciple is in life or you will never get ahead. My father works hard everyday and still has time for me and my sister. I think that all fathers should be like this. Someday I will look upon him and think that he really was a great father and I shall be like him too.</p>
